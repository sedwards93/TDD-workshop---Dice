A simple dice rolling app. Building upon skills learnt during the introduction to TDD workshop.
The challenge was to test drive a simple command line program based off the following user requirements:

So that I can play a game
I want to be able to roll a dice

As a board game player,
So that I know how many steps I should move
Rolling a dice should give me a number between 1 and 6

As a dice app developer,
So that I give players a good game experience
If it is not already random, I want the dice roll to be randomly picked

As a board game player,
So that I can play many types of games
I want to be able to roll any number of dice at the same time

As a board game player,
So that I can keep track of past and previous rolls
I want to record each dice roll

As a board game player,
So that I know what my score is after I have rolled several dice
I want to be able to get my current score
